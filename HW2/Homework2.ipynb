    "The objective is to minimize the total network cost, which includes the cost of capacity expansion and the penalty cost for user rejection (when there is no bike or no free dock), making the capacity ($\\mathbf{S_i}$) a discrete variable.

    "### Different Scenario Analysis\n",

    "#### Why this Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial execution of the linear model resulted in an optimal investment of **€0**, indicating that under the current parameter settings, the Cost of Infrastructure ($C_{slot}$) significantly outweighs the Penalty for Service Failure ($P_{penalty}$). Because this is a linear optimization model, the decision logic is mathematically **binary**: the solver simply calculates whether it is cheaper to build a slot or pay the penalty. To validate the robustness of our expansion plan, we must compare two opposing strategic realities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scenario A:**\n",
    "    * **Parameters:** Cost = €500 | Penalty = €5 ($C_{slot} > P_{penalty}$)\n",
    "    * **Logic:** This represents a financial strategy where budget protection is prioritized over service levels. Since the cost of construction is 100 times higher than the cost of rejecting a user, the mathematical optimum is to **freeze investment** and accept high rejection rates. In this scenario, it is simply \"cheaper to pay the fine than to fix the problem.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scenario B:**\n",
    "    * **Parameters:** Cost = €500 | Penalty = €600 ($P_{penalty} > C_{slot}$)\n",
    "    * **Logic:** This simulates a strategic shift where BiciMad prioritizes brand reputation. By setting the penalty higher than the construction cost, the model effectively understands that losing a recurring customer is more expensive than building a single slot. This forces the solver to utilize the entire budget to avoid rejections, leading to a massive expansion of the network."

    "### Interpretation of Results: \n",
    "\n",
    "In Scenario B, the model uses **100% of the available budget (€100,000)**. This behavior is a critical economic indicator of the network's status. The reasons for this total budget usage are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Positive Net Benefit\n",
    "In Scenario B, the parameters create a net benefit for every new slot:\n",
    "* **Cost to Build:** €500\n",
    "* **Penalty Saved:** €600\n",
    "* **Net Benefit per Slot:** +€100\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the net benefit is positive, the solver determines that **building a slot is always strictly better than not building one**. Consequently, the instruction becomes: *\"Build as many slots as physically and financially possible.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The Budget as the Binding Constraint\n",
    "Since the model is incentivized to expand indefinitely to eliminate penalties, it will continue to add slots until it hits a limit. In this case, the **Budget Constraint ($B_{max}$)** acts as the bottleneck. The model stops investing at exactly €100,000 not because the network is fixed, but simply because it has run out of capital. This indicates that the budget constraint is **binding**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Massive Structural Deficit\n",
    "The most important strategic insight from this result is the magnitude of the infrastructure gap.\n",
    "* The fact that the budget is fully exhausted implies that **the cost to fix the network's total deficit is significantly higher than €100,000.**\n",
    "* If the network only needed €50,000 to solve all rejection problems, the model would have spent €50,000 and stopped.\n",
    "* Since it hit the €100,000 ceiling immediately, we can conclude that the BiciMad network is **severely underfunded** relative to the actual user demand, assuming a customer-centric service standard."

    "### Budget Saturation & Structural Deficit Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the true scale of the network's infrastructure deficit, we performed a test by incrementally increasing the available budget ($B_{max}$) under a service-focused strategy (Penalty > Cost). The results reveal the financial requirement to fully optimize the BiciMad network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Complete Budget Usage (€100k – €2M)\n",
    "For all budget levels up to **2 000 000€**, the model exhibits **100% Budget Utilization**. \n",
    "* This consumption indicates massive unfulfilled demand. \n",
    "* Even with a 20x increase in the current budget (from 100k€ to 2M€), the network needs more slots, proving that the infrastructure is severely undersized relative to user demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The Saturation Point (€3,227,500)\n",
    "The analysis identifies the precise **Saturation Point at 3 227 500€** (6,455 new slots).\n",
    "* When provided with 5 000 000€, the model stops spending at approx. 3.2M€. \n",
    "* **Meaning:** At this investment level, every single station where expansion is physically possible ($S_{max}$) and economically viable has been expanded. Throwing more money at the problem beyond 3.2M€ yields no further benefit because the demand is fully covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Strategic Conclusion: \n",
    "Comparing the saturation point to the current allocation reveals a critical gap:\n",
    "* **Required Budget:** €3,227,500\n",
    "* **Current Budget:** €100,000\n",
    "* **Coverage:** **3.1%**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Insight:** The current budget of €100,000 covers only **~3%** of the network's actual infrastructure needs. To transition from a \"Financial Focus\" to a \"Service Excellence\" standard, BiciMad would need to increase its capital allocation by a factor of **32x**. The current investment is not a solution, but merely a patch on a much larger structural problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transition to Part B:** infrastructure alone does not guarantee service quality. A station with 50 newly built slots is useless if it contains 0 bycicles during a crowded hour, or if it is completely full when someone tries to return a bike."

    "\n",
    "Having defined the optimal infrastructure in Part A, we now shift our focus to the **daily operational challenges**. A station's capacity is only effective if it is actively managed to match the fluctuating hourly demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we analyze the inventory dynamics of **Station 57**, selected as a representative critical node due to its high rotation and demand volatility. Unlike the static linear approach used for network expansion, we employ a **Non-Linear Optimization Model** to minimize the Total Daily Cost. This model balances two conflicting objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Operational Costs:** The linear cost of logistical rebalancing (transporting bikes via trucks).\n",
    "2.  **Service Quality Costs:** The quadratic penalty associated with service failures (users unable to rent or return bikes).\n",

    "### Interpretation of Results \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Efficiency and Costs\n",
    "* **Solution Status: `Optimization terminated successfully`**\n",
    "  The solver (SLSQP) successfully converged to an optimal solution, balancing the cost of moving bicycles with the penalty of rejecting users.\n",
    "* **Total Daily Cost: `€0.56`**\n",
    "  * **Linear Rebalancing Cost: `€0.55`**\n",
    "  * **Non-linear Penalty Cost: `€0.00`**\n",
    "  The extremely low total cost indicates that the station can be managed almost perfectly. The model found that by spending only **€0.55** on rebalancing, it can completely eliminate user rejections (penalty cost of €0.00).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Inventory Stability (Optimal Stock)\n",
    "* **Stock Management:** The `Stock_Optimo` remains remarkably stable throughout the 24-hour cycle, staying between **11.9** and **13.2** bicycles.\n",
    "* **Safety Margin:** Since the station capacity is **24 slots**, the model keeps the inventory at approximately **50% capacity**. This is a classic \"buffer\" strategy: it ensures there are always enough bikes for departures and enough empty docks for arrivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Rebalancing Strategy ($R_h$)\n",
    "* **Precision Adjustments:** The model performs very small rebalancing actions (e.g., $+0.03$ or $+0.01$ bikes/min) during most of the day. This suggests that the natural flow of users at Station 57 is relatively balanced.\n",
    "* **Peak Hour Intervention:** The most significant rebalancing occurs in the evening (Periods 17, 18, and 19):\n",
    "    * **Period 18:** The model adds bikes ($R_h = 0.60$) to prepare for high evening demand.\n",
    "    * **Period 19:** The model removes bikes ($R_h = -0.60$) to prevent the station from becoming full as arrivals increase.\n",
    "* This \"just-in-time\" rebalancing prevents the station from reaching 0 (empty) or 24 (full).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. User Experience and Rejections\n",
    "* **Inbound/Outbound Rejections: `0.00`**\n",
    "  The primary goal of the model was to minimize the non-linear penalty of rejecting users. The results show **zero rejections** for both people trying to rent a bike and people trying to return one. \n",
    "* This demonstrates that with a proactive rebalancing strategy, Station 57 can achieve a **100% service level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Strategic Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part B** proves that at the station level, **logistics (rebalancing) is the key to success.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Power of Rebalancing:** By making tiny, calculated adjustments to the inventory throughout the day, BiciMad can avoid the \"empty station\" or \"full station\" syndrome without expensive infrastructure investments.\n",
    "* **Operational Recommendation:** Focus on \"micro-rebalancing\" during the transitions between morning and evening peaks to maintain the inventory near the 50% mark."

    "### Insights from this Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The system shows vulnerability in Scenario A, proving that the current logistic capacity is not enough to cover the entire demand in huge events or peak hours. Increasing the fleet capacity is very important in these cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robustness in returns:** in contrast, the system handles properly the High Supply case. The station's capacity buffer combined with standard rebalance is capable of absorbing the increase in returns of bikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Natural Balance:** Scenario C works better than Scenario A. This suggests that the system naturally self balances when the mobility increases globally (more departures and more arrivals). The high volume of incoming bikes helps satisfying the volume of needed bikes for departures, reducing the need of the rebalancing truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the system's results, we can conclude that logistics should focus on bringing new bikes to the stations rather than removing them. This is because the system struggles the most when the demand increases, leading to a lot of users' discontent."
